Correctness:

- The program has a runtime error:
$ java driver < testcase.txt
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string:""
  at
java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
  at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:504)
  at aescipher.aesSBox(aescipher.java:225)
  at aescipher.generateWMatrix(aescipher.java:118)
  at aescipher.aesRoundKeys(aescipher.java:63)
  at driver.main(driver.java:23)



Style:

- There is incorrect indentation in the aescipher file

- Good block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.

Efficiency and Other Comments:

- The usage of HashMap may make your program less efficient.
